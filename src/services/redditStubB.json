This isn\u2019t even mentioning the presentations highlighting the system\u2019s features, first party software, and third party support. However, despite all of this knowledge, there\u2019s still something missing\u2026 oh yeah, that\u2019s right, the indie titles for the system which just so happened to be revealed/announced in a showcase this very article is based around.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESteamworld Dig 2 \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKicking off the showcase of upcoming Nintendo Switch indie games was the reveal of the sequel to the critically acclaimed Image and Form game, Steamworld Dig (what else would it be a sequel to\u2026). Like many other games during this showcase, only a snippet of footage and Information was given about this sequel. All we know about the game is that it has smoother graphics than the original (with the downside of stiff animations), and has a plot which revolves around you playing as a character looking for her long lost friend.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReleases Summer 2017\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETeam 17 Games\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the announcement for Steamworld Dig 2, the showcase started to present games based on who published them. The first publisher to begin this format was Team 17 and their dissemination of a trailer for the Switch version of Yooka Laylee. Not much was shown in this aforementioned trailer; however, except for the fact that the game will have multiplayer (not known whether it\u2019s exclusive to the Switch and whether it\u2019s local and/or online multiplayer) in the form of mini-games. The other two games revealed for the Switch by Team 17 were Overcooked: Special Edition, and Escapists 2. What makes the Switch version of these games different from other console iterations is that in Overcooked SE, all the dlc is included and it supports the HD Rumble feature. As for Escapists 2, that was simply modified to allow drop-in drop-out multiplayer. Despite already being released on other consoles, I\u2019m excited for the Switch versions of these games because of their aforementioned new features.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll games in this section release 2017\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERaw Fury Games\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENext up in the presentation was the announcement of games by Raw Fury Games. Two of the three titles revealed, Dandara and Gonner, are both side-scrolling action platformers. While I have nothing but mild interest for Gonner, Dandara instantly had me sold with its slick sprite work. In addition to these two games was the reveal of a title by the name of Kingdom Two Crowns which merely stated how it would have a coop mode and that the world would change based on your actions. All in all, Raw Fury has some interesting games which would be more intriguing and attention gathering if just a tad more bit of information was given to us about them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDandara releases Summer 2017\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGonner and Kingdom Two Crowns release 2017\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChoice Provisions, Inti Creates, and Zoink Games\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince the next three games shown were by different publishers, I\u2019ve decided to cram them all into one section. With that being said, the game announced by Choice Provisions was Runner 3. For those of you who don\u2019t know, the Runner series is an automated platformer (meaning the game automatically makes you run) with the trailer for Runner 3 making it seem like one of the heaviest acid trips one could ever experience. Though, despite this, it\u2019s this nature and smooth graphics which make me intrigued to pick up this game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough it was announced prior to this showcase, the game \u201crevealed\u201d by Inti Creates was Blaster Master Zero. Blaster Master Zero is a new entry in a franchise that has been dead for many years up until this point in time. This title piques my interest with its mix of a platformer and top-down shooter that manages to outshine the game\u2019s bland eight-bit graphics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EArguably the best part of the presentation, the game Zoink Games announced was Flipping Death, a game that follows a girl by the name of Penny Doewood who must solve the problems of the dead after she, herself, meets her untimely end. This is done by possessing humans and objects in the land of the living in order to fulfill the tasks you need to complete. Flipping Death\u2019s extremely quirky nature and promising mechanics is what won me over in thinking it was the best aspect of this showcase.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERunner 3 releases Fall 2017\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBlaster Master Zero releases March 9th\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlipping Death releases 2017\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHighlighted HD Rumble Games\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilar to the previous section, the next collection of revealed games can be categorized into a single section as they are all games meant to represent the features of HD Rumble (it sounds super cheesy whenever that feature is ever brought up). These games were: Graceful Explosion Machine by Vertex Pop, Mr. Shifty by TinyBuild Games, and Tumbleseed by Aeiowu. With little information being given about these games, all we know is that GEM is a side-scrolling arcade shooter, Mr. Shifty a stealth game where you teleport through enemies and obstacles, and Tumbleseed, which is a rouge-like physics game (however that works) where you balance a seed whilst avoiding/interacting with objects. Oh, and don\u2019t forget, these games have the radical power of HD Rummmmmmmmmmmmmmble.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGraceful Explosion Machine and Mr. Shifty release April\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETumbleseed releases Spring\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVBlank Entertainment\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELemme just say, Retro City Rampage was a great experience that constantly had me chuckling with its jests at overused gaming conventions, cliches, and infamous nods to parts of gaming past. So, when a gloriously detailed 16-bit sequel by the name of Shakedown Hawaii was \u201crevealed\u201d (same case as Blaster Master Zero with it being announced prior to this showcase) you can imagine how much I flipped my nargles. Aside from the aforementioned fantastic graphics, the game seems to have more intense shootouts, weapons, and best of all, destructible environments, making it a promising title to keep your eyes on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReleases April\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChucklefish Games\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWrapping up this showcase were three games announced by Chucklefish Games. The first game announced by them was Pocket Rumble, a smooth 8-bit 2-d fighter that has \u201csimple controls with a strong level of depth.\u201d In addition to that, the game was also stated to have local multiplayer as well as ranked online matches.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond up for games by Chucklefish was a title called Wargroove, a strategic RPG that is a mix of Fire Emblem and Advanced Wars what with its grid gameplay, battle animations, and army mechanics. Couple this with local/online battles and the ability to create and share maps online, and you have a promising little successor to Advance Wars, and to a lesser degree, Fire Emblem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBearing the role as last game announced and best part of the showcase second to Flipping Death was the reveal of a Nintendo Switch version of Stardew Valley. For those of you who have been living under a rock for the past year, Stardew Valley is a charming mix between a farming simulator and RPG that I have sadly not been able to play yet. This is not only going to change since it\u2019s being released on Nintendo Switch, but also because its the first console version of the game to include the feature of multiplayer, making it the definitive version both for newcomers and present owners of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPocket Rumble releases March\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWargroove releases 2017\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStardew Valley releases Summer\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I\u2019ve stated two occasions which I thought to be the best moments of this showcase, all of the games, in truth, are equal in many ways. Meaning, these games are all equal in their potential and level of hype due to their own unique charms. And, even though some games had too little information disclosed about them, it just makes me yearn to know more about them. This showcase has been the deciding factor in ending my reluctance about the Switch\u2019s success because with games such as these releasing on it, there\u2019s no way it can be a failure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\u003C!-- SC_ON --\u003E",
